		\subsubsection{Efficiency model}
			The motor efficiency model was derived from an efficiency plot provided by the manufacturer.

			The efficiency plot is based on variables which are convenient to measure using an engine dynamometer and a power inverter. In future testing, the efficiency function will be derived from steady-state experimental data.
			
		\subsubsection{Equivalent-circuit parameters}
			The motor manufacturer specifies values for $L_d$, $L_q$, and $R$. Since the model performance was good without additional calibration of these values, they were used unchanged.
			
			The only equivalent-circuit parameter that was calibrated in the model was $\phi$, the permanent-magnet flux linkage.

				\begin{tabular}{c | l | c | c}
					Symbol		&	Parameter			&	Initial guess value	&	Calibrated value	\\
					\hline
					$\phi$		&	Motor flux linkage		&	1 V rad/sec	 	&	-1.051 V rad/sec
				\end{tabular}
			\end{table}
			
			Since there was no calibration data available that included a motor torque output, the model was calibrated against a subset of the experimental data from RW-2x coastdown testing (the same dataset used for validating the overall vehicle model). The coastdown test data was chosen because it covered a wide range of vehicle speeds and motor currents.

	\subsection{Model validation and quality of fit}
		The model was validated using the full coastdown dataset from RW-2x vehicle testing. Motor output torque was not directly measured during this testing, so the validation focused on accurate prediction of the motor equivalent-circuit voltages $V_d$ and $V_q$. 
		
		\begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Vq_Vd}
			\caption{Motor model performance: simulated $V_q$, $V_d$ vs. measured data.}
		\end{figure}
		\FloatBarrier
		
		The model performance for $V_q$ is very good, even during transients. 
		
		The model does not predict $V_d$ well. Some possible sources of this error include:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item		Large applied voltages by the motor controller in an attempt to control for $I_d = 0$
			\item		Larger than expected coupling between the d- and q-axis circuits
			\item		Larger than expected $\frac{d i_d}{d t}$ or $L_d$
		\end{itemize}
